# Demo application for transfer learning

## Overview

This version of the demo shows how to apply **MORPH** to user-provided single-cell data **using a pre-trained model** we provide. Unlike the [user input demo](user_demo.md), which trains MORPH from scratch, this variant demonstrates how to **fine-tune** a model that has already been trained on large-scale perturbation data.

Leveraging a pre-trained model can significantly improve performanceâ€”especially in real-world settingsâ€”by transferring learned representations from related datasets. We recommend this approach for most practical applications, as it makes the most of the available prior knowledge.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend running this version **after** you have tried the demo with the test input data, as described [here](test_demo.md).

## Step-by-step guide

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you proceed make sure that you have followed the instructions in the [README file](README.md) of this repository.
> To run the code please ensure that your working directory is ``MORPH``. The working directory can be changed via the ``cd`` command.

### 1. Activate the bash shell and conda environment
Please open a new terminal and activate the Bash shell by running:
```
bash
```

Then, activate the Conda environment you set up earlier by running:
```
conda activate morph
```

*Make sure to run the model within this conda environment, which contains all the necessary packages.*

### 2. Set MORPH as your working directory
Please navigate to the directory where you cloned the GitHub repository:
```
cd path/to/MORPH
```
Replace `path/to/MORPH` with the actual path on your machine.

### 3. Process and configure the input single-cell data
1. Preprocess your single-cell dataset by following the example in `demo/data_tutorial_transfer_learning.ipynb`.  
   *(Note: this is a different notebook than the one used in the standard demo.)*
2. Open the file located at `MORPH/data/scdata_file_path.csv` and add a new row to specify the path to your processed data:
    - In the `dataset` column, enter: `[your_data_id]` (a unique identifier for your dataset).
    - In the `file_path` column of the same row, enter the full path to your processed `.h5ad` file.

If you're seeing an error related to "Mismatch in gene sets", it likely means that the input gene list does not match what the released model expects. As explained in `demo/data_tutorial_transfer_learning.ipynb`, **you cannot directly fine-tune the released model if the genes do not align.**

However, you can still leverage the power of transfer learning by following these steps:

1. **Identify your source and target datasets.**  
   We recommend using the genome-wide Perturb-seq dataset from [Replogle et al. (2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867422005979?via%3Dihub) as the source dataset.

2. **Subset both datasets to their overlapping genes.**  
   Follow the instructions in `demo/data_tutorial_transfer_learning.ipynb` to identify the shared genes and align the two datasets accordingly.

3. **Normalize and preprocess the data.**  
   Use `demo/data_tutorial.ipynb` to perform standard normalization and preprocessing on the two aligned datasets.

4. **Train MORPH on the source dataset.**  
   Refer to [user_demo](user_demo.md) to train a new MORPH model using your processed source data.

5. **Fine-tune MORPH on your target dataset.**  
   Adapt the trained MORPH model to your target dataset by following the next steps in the tutorial.

### 4. Create the train-test splits
1. Create a train-test split for your data following the example in `demo/split_tutorial.ipynb` 
2. Name this file as `[your_data_id]_splits.csv` (**Note: the data id must match what you have above**)
3. Save this file to the following directory:
```
MORPH/data
```

### 5. Download and configure the prior knowledge
Download the file named `depmap_crispr_gene_effect_processed.pkl` from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TQJE281q4xH7HcNHMg1v0urD99EDj5bO?usp=drive_link).

Then, open the file located at:
```
MORPH/data/perturb_embed_file_path.csv
```
and find the row where `representation_type` is `DepMap_GeneEffect`, and update the `file_path` column to the location of the downloaded DepMap file on your machine.

> [!NOTE]
> Because the pre-trained model was trained using **DepMap** as the source of prior knowledge, we recommend using **DepMap** embeddings when performing transfer learning. If you prefer to use a different type of prior knowledge (e.g., foundation model embeddings or pathway-based features), you should **retrain the model from scratch** using your chosen prior, and then follow the same steps outlined here.
> Note: In some contexts, alternative priors may outperform DepMap, depending on the biological setting and data domain.

### 6. Download the pre-trained model
1. Go to this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TQJE281q4xH7HcNHMg1v0urD99EDj5bO?usp=drive_link)
2. Download the folder named: `replogle_gwps_trained_model_small`
> ðŸ’¡ **Note:**  
> We also provide a larger version of the model called `replogle_gwps_trained_model_large`, trained on the same dataset but with increased model capacity.

The folder you download should contain the following files:
- `model.pt` â€“ the pretrained model weights  
- `config.json` â€“ the model configuration file
3. Create a new folder inside your MORPH project directory:
```
bash
mkdir -p MORPH/transfer_learning
```
4. Move the downloaded folder into this new directory (manually or with the command: `mv /path/to/replogle_gwps_trained_model_small MORPH/transfer_learning/`)
After this, your directory structure should look like:
```
MORPH/
â””â”€â”€ transfer_learning/
    â””â”€â”€ replogle_gwps_trained_model_small/
        â”œâ”€â”€ model.pt
        â””â”€â”€ config.json
```


### 7. Fine-tune the model on your dataset
Navigate to the `MORPH/morph/analysis/cell_line_transfer` folder. If you've followed the previous steps, you can do this by typing the following in your terminal:
```
cd morph/analysis/cell_line_transfer
```

Next, open the `cell_line_transfer_few_shot_learning.py` file and update the following fields:
- Set `test_dataset` to `[your_data_id]` â€” this should match the ID you used in `scdata_file_path.csv`.
- Set `leave_out_test_set_id` to the appropriate split ID â€” this should correspond to the ID specified in your train-test split file under column `test_set_id` (created in step 4).

You can also customize or optimize hyperparameters in this file.

To run MORPH using the default settings and automatically evaluate the results upon completion, execute:
```
python -u cell_line_transfer_few_shot_learning.py
```
