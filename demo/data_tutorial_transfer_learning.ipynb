    "# Tutorial on preparing single-cell data for MORPH transfer learning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1. Standard data preprocessing\n",
    "MORPH expects input in the form of a `Scanpy` AnnData object (`adata`) that meets the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Perturbation Labels** (`adata.obs['gene']`)\n",
    " - The `adata.obs` DataFrame must include a column named `gene`, which specifies the perturbation applied to each cell.\n",
    " - Use the following labeling format:\n",
    "    - Control cells: 'non-targeting'\n",
    "    - Single perturbations: e.g., 'GeneA'\n",
    "    - Double perturbations: e.g., 'GeneA+GeneB' (with gene names joined by a +)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Gene Expression Matrix** (`adata.X`)\n",
    " - The `.X` matrix should contain **either raw gene expression counts** or **imaging features** for each cell, depending on the modality of your dataset.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Step 2. Data Alignment (specific to transfer learning)\n",
    "Since the released model was trained on the genome-wide Perturb-seq dataset from [Replogle et al. (2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867422005979?via%3Dihub), it is important to ensure that your input data is aligned with the training data. Specifically, the gene names must match in exact order and content. Below is a sample code snippet to perform this alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3. Preprocessing\n",
    "If you are using raw gene expression counts, please follow the steps in [`data_tutorial.ipynb`](data_tutorial.ipynb) to preprocess the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: please process the data *only* after alignment**"
